# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis (Past–Present–Future)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a **comprehensive 3-phase analysis of global CO₂ emissions** using **Power BI** for visualization and **Python (Prophet)** for forecasting.  
The goal is to track historical trends, understand current sectoral contributions, and forecast future emissions to support **data-driven climate decision-making**.

---

## ⚡ Key Features
- **3-Phase Analysis**
  - **Past (1960–2023):** Historical emissions trends by country and region.
  - **Present:** Sector-wise breakdown of current emissions (energy, transport, etc.).
  - **Future (2024–2053):** Forecasted emissions using Prophet time-series modeling.

- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**
  - Country-level insights & top emitters
  - Sector contributions with dynamic filters
  - Forecasting outputs integrated with KPIs
  - Scenario planning with slicers and DAX measures

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** → Dashboard, KPIs, DAX measures, filters  
- **Python (Prophet)** → Time-series forecasting  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** → Exploratory analysis & validation

## 🔑 Key Insights
- CO₂ emissions have **steadily increased since 1960**, with sharp rises in industrializing countries.  
- **Energy & Transport** sectors are currently the largest contributors.  
- Without intervention, emissions are projected to **rise significantly by 2053**.  

---

## 🚀 How This Project Adds Value
- Provides a **decision-ready visualization** for policymakers, researchers, and businesses.  
- Combines **historical, present, and predictive analytics** in one interactive platform.  
- Demonstrates ability to **integrate Python forecasting with BI dashboards** for end-to-end analysis.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Incorporate **real-time emission datasets** (via APIs).  
- Add **policy intervention scenarios** to simulate possible outcomes.  
- Enhance dashboard with **geospatial analysis (maps)**.
